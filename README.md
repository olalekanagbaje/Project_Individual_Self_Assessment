# Project_Individual_Self_Assessment
The aim of our selected project is to design a suitable Machine Learning Model that can help to analyze various clinical factors in hospitalized patients with diabetes in order to predict the likelihood of re-admission of such patients for their condition at a later date.

## Self-Assessment
As a team member on this project, I researched & identified the dataset that was used for the project, generated and worked on the machine learning models that were eventually used for the predictions. I was also responsible for generating the Readme report that accompanied the project deliverable. In addition, I also actively partook in all review meetings / essions for the pre-processing & feature engineering of our selected dataset, review of PgAdmin database creation work for the dataset, review of various dashboard creation activities and our final presentation slides etc. For these activities, we set up several Zoom & Discord meeting sessions where all members of the group collectively reviewed every generated lines of codes from each team member and debatd and agreed several suggestions that were used to further enhance the quality of our project work. Majority of the adopted suggestions were implemented directly in these review meetings under the guidance and input from every team member.

From my point of view, my greatest personal challenge on the project centered around time management especially as it related to project activities / deliverables assigned to me at different points by the team. It was a struggle because the 4 weeks project delivery time period coincided with a very demanding period for me at work, so on several ocassions, I had to work very late into the night to deliver timely on several tasks that had been assigned to me by the team.   

## Team Assessment
To achieve success as a team on this project, we ensured that we set up sevral meeting times outside the official Tuesday's & Thursday's meet-up in order to keep up with our project works. We often met as a team about 2 additional times outside the official times every week during the course of the project. 

As a team, our primary means of communications were;
1. Slack - For instant message communications (chats) among team members and to communicate general information to all team members
2. Zoom - We adopted zoom as our primary team meeting platform during the early days of the project
3. Discord - Later on, we switched from zoom and adopted Discord as our primary team meeting platform

From a communication protocol perpspective, one challenge that we struggled with initially was the 30 minutes time restrictions that we experienced during our zoom (free version) team meetings. Most times, our team meetings strectched well beyond an hour but we were able to resolve this challenge by switching to Discord, an entirely free and flexible platform with no time restriction for meetings.

Our collective strength and success as a team during this project revolved around the additional quality time that we colectively devoted as a team to meet outside offical times to discuss & debate progress, challenges and next steps for our projects. We also ensured that every debates / discussions about the progress of the project resulted in actionable activities that were agreeable to every team member. We also encouraged team members to quickly speakup whenever they encountered challenges that may impede the progress of the project. Finally, as a team, we were quick to also engage our assigned project Technical Assistant / Supervisor for guidance whenever we needed external support on an issue.

The above are suggestions that I would readily share with a new cohort starting off a project.

## Summary of the Project
In summary, this project involved the use of Random Forest Classifier (RFC) to analyze various clinical factors in hospitalized patients with diabetes in order to predict the likelihood of re-admission of such patients for their condition at a later date. In predicting the likelihood of daibetes patients readmission, the RFC generated a 66% Accuracy Score, 56% Precision Score, 27% Recall Score & 36% F1 Score.
